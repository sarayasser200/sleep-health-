Developed a machine learning pipeline to classify sleep disorders using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) for supervised learning, and K-Means clustering for unsupervised learning. Evaluated model performance with classification metrics and visualized results using scatter plots and decision boundaries.
Achieved insightful data visualization and robust model evaluation.
